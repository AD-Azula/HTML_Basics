          <h3>Frasier</h3>
          <p>
            Frasier is an American television sitcom that was broadcast on NBC
            for 11 seasons, premiering on September 16, 1993, and concluding on
            May 13, 2004. The program was created and produced by David Angell,
            Peter Casey, and David Lee (as Grub Street Productions) in
            association with Grammnet (2004) and Paramount Network Television.
            The series was created as a spin-off of Cheers, continuing the story
            of psychiatrist Frasier Crane as he returned to his hometown of
            Seattle and started building a new life as a radio advice show host
            while reconnecting with his father and brother and making new
            friends.

            Dr. Frasier Crane, a successful Boston therapist, moves to Seattle
            following his divorce to get a new start on life; he has a radio
            talk show, where he relays his wit and wisdom to aide callers, while
            dealing with a changed homelife living with his salt-of-the-earth
            father, Martin Crane (John Mahoney), and the senior Crane's physical
            therapist, Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves). Frasier also reconnects with
            his sometimes uptight brother, Niles Crane (David Hyde Pierce), and
            finds new friends among his colleagues, especially his brash show
            producer, Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin).

          Frasier is one of the most critically acclaimed comedy series of all
          time and one of the most successful spin-off series in television
          history. Critics and commentators have broadly held the show in high
          regard. The series won a total of 37 Primetime Emmy Awards during its
          11-year run, breaking the record long held by CBS' The Mary Tyler
          Moore Show. It held the record until 2016 when Game of Thrones won 38.
          Grammer and Pierce each won four, including one each for the fifth and
          eleventh seasons. The series is tied with ABC's Modern Family for the
          most consecutive wins for Outstanding Comedy Series, winning five from
          1994 to 1998. Grammer has been Emmy-nominated for playing Frasier
          Crane on Cheers and Frasier, as well as a 1992 crossover appearance on
          Wings, making him the only performer to be nominated for playing the
          same role on three different shows. The first year Grammer did not
          receive an Emmy nomination for Frasier was in 2003 for the 10th
          season. However, Pierce was nominated every year of the show's run,
          breaking the record for nominations in his category, with his eighth
          nomination in 2001; he was nominated a further three times after this.
          In 1994, the episode "The Matchmaker" was ranked number 43 on TV
          Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. In 2000, the series was
          named the greatest international programme of all time by a panel of
          1,600 industry experts for the British Film Institute as part of BFI
          TV 100. In 2002, Frasier was ranked number 34 on TV Guide's 50
          Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In a 2006 poll taken by Channel 4 of
          professionals in the sitcom industry, Frasier was voted the best
          sitcom of all time.
