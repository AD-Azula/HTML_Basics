          <h3>Frasier</h3>
          <p>
            Frasier is an American television sitcom that was broadcast on NBC
            for 11 seasons, premiering on September 16, 1993, and concluding on
            May 13, 2004. The program was created and produced by David Angell,
            Peter Casey, and David Lee (as Grub Street Productions) in
            association with Grammnet (2004) and Paramount Network Television.
            The series was created as a spin-off of Cheers, continuing the story
            of psychiatrist Frasier Crane as he returned to his hometown of
            Seattle and started building a new life as a radio advice show host
            while reconnecting with his father and brother and making new
            friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Frasier Crane, a successful Boston therapist, moves to Seattle
            following his divorce to get a new start on life; he has a radio
            talk show, where he relays his wit and wisdom to aide callers, while
            dealing with a changed homelife living with his salt-of-the-earth
            father, Martin Crane (John Mahoney), and the senior Crane's physical
            therapist, Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves). Frasier also reconnects with
            his sometimes uptight brother, Niles Crane (David Hyde Pierce), and
            finds new friends among his colleagues, especially his brash show
            producer, Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin).

        <p class="sidenotes">
          Frasier is one of the most critically acclaimed comedy series of all
          time and one of the most successful spin-off series in television
          history. Critics and commentators have broadly held the show in high
          regard. The series won a total of 37 Primetime Emmy Awards during its
          11-year run, breaking the record long held by CBS' The Mary Tyler
          Moore Show. It held the record until 2016 when Game of Thrones won 38.
          Grammer and Pierce each won four, including one each for the fifth and
          eleventh seasons.
