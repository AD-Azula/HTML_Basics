            According to John Mahoney, Moose (Eddie) got more fan mail than any
            of the human cast members.

            Kelsey Grammer used an acting method that he called "requisite
            disrespect". He would rehearse each scene only once, and he would
            not learn his lines until a few moments before each scene was shot.
            Grammer felt that his method brought energy and realism to his
            performance. The cast and crew got used to it, but guest stars did
            not like his method.

            David Hyde Pierce has said that, prior to this series, he had no
            strong interest in wine nor opera. Ironically, he was introduced to
            both by John Mahoney, whose Martin Crane character eschews anything
            cultured.

            The series was originally going to cast an actress to portray Niles'
            (David Hyde Pierce's) wife Maris, but after the first couple of
            seasons, the writers found they had too much fun writing her as an
            unseen character, and as the descriptions of her became more
            outlandish and contradictory, they felt finding the right actress
            would be close to impossible.

            In a final season interview, John Mahoney said the first offer he
            received to play Martin Crane consisted of a phone call from Kelsey
            Grammer, in which he asked, "Will you be my Dad?"

            The two final choices for the role of Roz were Peri Gilpin and Lisa
            Kudrow. Kudrow was originally cast, because her line readings were
            funnier. But during rehearsals, the show's creators felt that Kudrow
            lacked the forcefulness needed to play Roz, and she was replaced
            with Gilpin.

            Moose (the original Eddie) was fourteen when this show ended. His
            fur had turned snow white and he was almost completely deaf, but his
            trainer carried him out on-stage after the final episode was
            recorded, so that he could take his bows with the rest of the cast.
            David Hyde Pierce later said that it was one of the most moving
            moments of the evening, watching Moose recognize and react to the
            applause one last time.

            Instead of recording call-in segments in the typical voice-over
            method, requiring actors to recite their lines at a recording
            studio, guest stars making an appearance as a caller on Frasier's
            radio show would simply have their lines recorded over the phone.
            This was both easier for the guest stars, allowing the show to land
            celebrities with busy schedules, as well as providing an added depth
            of realism for the segment.

            It is said in season eight that Daphne (Jane Leeves) has lost nine
            pounds and twelve ounces at the health spa. This is a reference and
            inside joke to the fact that Jane Leeves' was away on maternity
            leave, and her daughter Isabella's birth weight was nine pounds and
            twelve ounces.

            The show's theme song, "Tossed Salad & Scrambled Eggs," composed by
            Darryl Phinnessee and Bruce Miller, was performed by Kelsey Grammer.
            Phinnessee was not allowed to include direct references to
            psychiatry, radio, or Frasier. He wrote the lyrics "tossed salad and
            scrambled eggs" because they are "mixed up" like Frasier's patients.
            "The blues a-calling" refers to the people calling Frasier's radio
            show with their problems. Miller wanted Mel Torm√© to sing the theme,
            but the producers wanted Grammer. Grammer sang multiple versions,
            which were rotated throughout the series.

            Moose the dog played Eddie until he retired at the age of ten at the
            end of season seven. His son, Enzo took over the role. Moose had
            been bred with the idea of achieving a look-alike replacement when
            it became obvious that this show would have a long run. Enzo had two
            siblings, a sister named Miko, who was too small to play Eddie, and
            Moosie, who had noticeably different markings. Peri Gilpin (Roz)
            ended up adopting Moosie.
